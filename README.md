# Natural-Gas-Storage-Contract-Pricing-Model

## 💡 Overview

This project implements a prototype pricing model for valuing natural gas storage contracts. It simulates buying (injecting) gas when prices are low, storing it, and selling (withdrawing) it when prices are high. This code was developed as part of a task provided in the J.P. Morgan qualitative research Program on Forage. It demonstrates a simplified pricing function for valuing natural gas storage contracts, including injections, withdrawals, and storage costs.

## 🛠️ Features

- Flexible function to price storage contracts with:
  - Multiple injection & withdrawal dates
  - Volume constraints
  - Storage costs
  - Injection & withdrawal fees
- Visualizes cumulative storage levels over time
- Simple, clear code ready for further validation or production

## 📄 Files

- `price_model.py`: Core Python function.
- `example_notebook.ipynb`: Example use cases, plots, and outputs.
- `Nat_Gas.csv`: Example historical price data.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## 🚀 How to run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install requirements: `pip install pandas matplotlib`
3. Open the notebook or run `price_model.py`.
4. Adjust injection/withdrawal scenarios and plot results.
